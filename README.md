The project aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That means each phase will cover all aspects of DevOps, such as planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

## Phases 1 and 2: Introduction and DevOps Core

For these phases, the project is just started. Phase 1 is the creation/forking of the repository and phase 2 is a small image creation for the app that at this stage only stores and prints the version of the app and also assigns it to the image tag.

The build is done by running the `build.sh` script in the repository's root directory, which:
1. runs the script responsible for getting the latest version
2. Building the app with the `Dockerfile` thereby generating the image with the current version.


## Phase 3

Currenty in progress...
